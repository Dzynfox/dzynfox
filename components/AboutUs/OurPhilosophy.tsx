            The <b>triangular face</b> of a fox
            represents demonstration, insight, discovery, and higher outlook. It
            is often used to mark growth. The triangle also symbolizes strength.

            The <b>pointed ears</b> of a fox
            signify observation and perfectionism. People with pointed ears are
            like Sherlock Holmesâ€”highly perceptive. They notice things that
            others don't and tend to dwell on details to ensure perfection.

            A fox has an <b>elongated rostrum</b>.
            Elongation indicates better material quality and signifies the ability
            to stretch without weakening. The more elongated a fox is, the more
            formidable it becomes.

            <p className="my-4  leading-relaxed">
            A fox has a <b>bushy tail</b> that
            signifies eagerness, readiness, and excitement. The thick tail aids
            its balance and also acts as protection during the winter.
            </p>
            <p className="my-4  leading-relaxed">
            The fox symbolizes cleverness, independence, playfulness, and
            mischievousness. It represents beauty, protection, and good luck,
            serving as a helper and guide for active, motivated individuals.
