            The <span className="font-bold">triangular face</span> of a fox
            represents demonstration, insight, discovery, and higher outlook. It
            is often used to mark growth. The triangle also symbolizes strength.
            <span className="block h-8"></span>
            The <span className="font-bold">pointed ears</span> of a fox
            signify observation and perfectionism. People with pointed ears are
            like Sherlock Holmesâ€”highly perceptive. They notice things that
            others don't and tend to dwell on details to ensure perfection.
            <span className="block h-8"></span>
            A fox has an <span className="font-bold">elongated rostrum</span>.
            Elongation indicates better material quality and signifies the ability
            to stretch without weakening. The more elongated a fox is, the more
            formidable it becomes.
            <span className="block h-8"></span>
            A fox has a <span className="font-bold">bushy tail</span> that
            signifies eagerness, readiness, and excitement. The thick tail aids
            its balance and also acts as protection during the winter.
            <span className="block h-8"></span>
            The fox symbolizes cleverness, independence, playfulness, and
            mischievousness. It represents beauty, protection, and good luck,
            serving as a helper and guide for active, motivated individuals.
